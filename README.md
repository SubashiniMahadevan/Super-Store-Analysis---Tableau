# Super-Store-Analysis-Tableau


## Objective: 
Create an interactive dashboard in Tableau that provides insights into the sales performance of the Superstore for the given data. The dashboard should help identify trends, performance metrics, and areas for improvement.

## Key Components:

### Sales Overview: 
Create a visualization that shows total sales over time. Allow users to filter the view by year, quarter, and month to observe trends and patterns.

### Category and Sub-Category Analysis: 
Develop a chart that compares sales and profits across different categories and sub-categories. Highlight top-performing and underperforming sub-categories.

### Geographical Insights: 
Use a map to represent sales and profit margins across different regions and states. Enable drill-down functionality to view details by city.

### Customer Segment Analysis: 
Segment the customers into groups (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office) and analyze the sales and profit contribution of each segment.

### Product Analysis:
Identify the top 10 products in terms of sales and profits. Create a chart that showcases these products and their performance metrics.

### Order and Ship Mode Analysis: 
Compare the sales and shipping modes (e.g., Standard Class, Second Class, First Class, Same Day) to determine if there's a correlation between ship mode and sales performance or customer satisfaction.

### Discount Impact
Analyze the impact of discounts on sales and profits. Determine if there's an optimal discount range that maximizes profit without significantly hurting sales.

### Interactive Features:

●	Include filters for date range, region, category, sub-category, and customer segment to allow users to customize the view.
●	Add hover-over effects to display detailed information for specific data points or regions.
●	Implement dashboard actions where selecting a particular category or region updates other visualizations to reflect the selection.
